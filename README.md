# Disclaimer
I am not good at coding, very much beginner. Shit will not work. Send issues if stuff does not work.

# What even is this?
This is my personal list of websites that I remove various "bloat" from. "Bloat" can mean a variety of things in my definition. Along with "bloat," you will find CSS styles that either change website fonts, add accessibility (change colors), and etc.

# What exactly is "bloat?" What can it be?
Bloat can be, but is not limited to:
- AI features I don't use or aren't needed for a website to work (Startpage Vanish, Lumo AI, etc)
- Upsell 
- Donation reminders (Wikipedia)
- Account creation
- Sections of sites that either don't work or I do not need (Google, etc.)
  - This definition of bloat is very biased. Keep that in mind.
 
# Current websites
- Proton Mail (split into 2 parts)
- Google Gemini
- *Claude.ai
- *Startpage search
- *Wikipedia
- *Roblox
